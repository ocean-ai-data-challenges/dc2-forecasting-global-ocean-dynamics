# PPR Océan & Climat Data Challenge 2

Probabilistic short-term forecasting of upper ocean dynamics from gridded satellite-derived data and ARGO float data.

## Task description

Probabilistic short-term (a few tens of days) forecasting of upper ocean dynamics (scalar  and  vector  fields)  from  gridded  satellite-derived data (2D+T and sparsely sampled fields) and ARGO float data (sets of vertical profiles).

## Getting started

Check out the quick-start guide **[TODO: add link]** or the complete API docs **[TODO: add link]** for an extensive look into it's functionality.

## What is the PPR Océan & Climat?

It is a *Priority Research Project* launched by the French government and managed by the CNRS and Ifremer.
The project aims to structure French research forces to improve our understanding of the ocean and our protection efforts.
See the [project website](https://www.ocean-climat.fr/) (in French) for more details.
